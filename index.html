            Promise yourself you will become the person you wish to be. Don’t let yourself become consumed by greeds or falsehoods. Write down who you wish to become. A disciplined person, a person free of restrictions placed onto you by you, a better person. Be aware of it. Prioritize it. Require it. <br>
<br>
Make a promise to yourself that you will become who you want to be. This is not as simple as it sounds. This promise to yourself needs to be significant. It will hold the weight of all of what you want to accomplish. This promise needs to satisfy all and in doing so it should become most of what you think about. What you do should be to fulfill this promise. <br> 
<br>
My promise to myself: <br>
<br>
1. I am a person who isn’t controlled by urges.<br>
2. I am a person of constant improvement.<br>
3. I am a disciplined person.<br>
4. I am a person who craves knowledge and success.<br>
5. I am a person content with the way I live my life.<br>

            If you let yourself become someone consumed by urges, you will become the urges. When picturing who you wish to become, is this person consumed by the addictions and issues you face now? Of course not.<br>
<br>
“Just one last time”<br>
<br>
An incredibly harmful set of words that which strung together can be detrimental for ones health both physically and mentally. Whatever these desires may be, you will never quit if the cycle continues. One last time, one last time, one last time. You feel guilty every time but this isn’t about the guilt. Think about how giving into these urges effects you and your brain.<br>
<br>
“New year new me”<br>
<br>
A different set of words, harmful alike. You may start to become better for a couple weeks or maybe even a month but the “New Year New Me” mindset never lasts. If you do make progress, what’s stopping you from replacing that expression with a new one: New Month New Me. What about New Week New Me? This new way of bettering yourself will lay a stronger foundation for who you can become and will give way to new possibilities. If you live every day with the idea that you can better yourself and others around you, why wouldn’t you.<br>

            Allowing yourself down time is required, but don’t let this become an excuse.<br>
<br>
As you progress and develop, a break will be essential, however, it is common for one to excuse laziness as required time off. Growing means constant persistence toward your goals, aspirations, and your promises to yourself. These means commitment and energy toward what means the most. 2 steps forward one step back means even though you may not always be moving forward, you are still becoming stronger, learning, and improving. Once you have built a strong base, you can begin to chisel your way to perfection. Refinement of yourself means accepting that your environment needs to be aligned with your values, biotic and abiotic.<br> 
<br>
Biotic<br>
The people you surround yourself with will define who you are. It is remarkably straightforward. You can become whoever you desire by fraternizing with that person. If you circulate your life with athletes, you will become one. Success alike. If you have been chained down at a specific level of skill for too long, let yourself befriend people of higher levels of skill. You will forget you were ever chained down.<br>
<br>
Abiotic<br>
The things you do control you just as much as the people. What is life if you engage is disheartening activities? The music you listen to will leave you feeling akin to the music. Why solely listen to such bleak music when it leaves you bleak? Naturally, everyone feels emotions at some point in their lives due to reasons out of their control. People tend to listen to upsetting music if they feel upset however why limit yourself? This forces you to stay in this upsetting phase for a time beyond reason. Let yourself be indifferent to the next song that plays. Enjoy it.<br>
