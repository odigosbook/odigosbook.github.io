            Promise yourself you will become the person you wish to be. Don’t let yourself become consumed by greeds or falsehoods. Write down who you wish to become. A disciplined person, a person free of restrictions placed onto you by you, a better person. Be aware of it. Prioritize it. Require it.

Make a promise to yourself that you will become who you want to be. This is not as simple as it sounds. This promise to yourself needs to be significant. It will hold the weight of all of what you want to accomplish. This promise needs to satisfy all and in doing so it should become most of what you think about. What you do should be to fulfill this promise. 

My promise to myself:
1. I am a person who isn’t controlled by urges.
2. I am a person of constant improvement.
3. I am a disciplined person.
4. I am a person who craves knowledge and success.
5. I am a person content with the way I live my life.
