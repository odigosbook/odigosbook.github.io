            Promise yourself you will become the person you wish to be. Don’t let yourself become consumed by greeds or falsehoods. Write down who you wish to become. A disciplined person, a person free of restrictions placed onto you by you, a better person. Be aware of it. Prioritize it. Require it. <br>

Make a promise to yourself that you will become who you want to be. This is not as simple as it sounds. This promise to yourself needs to be significant. It will hold the weight of all of what you want to accomplish. This promise needs to satisfy all and in doing so it should become most of what you think about. What you do should be to fulfill this promise. <br> 

My promise to myself: <br>
1. I am a person who isn’t controlled by urges.<br>
2. I am a person of constant improvement.<br>
3. I am a disciplined person.<br>
4. I am a person who craves knowledge and success.<br>
5. I am a person content with the way I live my life.<br>

            If you let yourself become someone consumed by urges, you will become the urges. When picturing who you wish to become, is this person consumed by the addictions and issues you face now? Of course not.<br>
<br>
“Just one last time”<br>
<br>
An incredibly harmful set of words that which strung together can be detrimental for ones health both physically and mentally. Whatever these desires may be, you will never quit if the cycle continues. One last time, one last time, one last time. You feel guilty every time but this isn’t about the guilt. Think about how giving into these urges effects you and your brain.<br>
<br>
“New year new me”<br>
<br>
A different set of words, harmful alike. You may start to become better for a couple weeks or maybe even a month but the “New Year New Me” mindset never lasts. If you do make progress, what’s stopping you from replacing that expression with a new one: New Month New Me. What about New Week New Me? This new way of bettering yourself will lay a stronger foundation for who you can become and will give way to new possibilities. If you live every day with the idea that you can better yourself and others around you, why wouldn’t you.<br>
