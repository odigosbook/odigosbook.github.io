            Promise yourself you will become the person you wish to be. Don’t let yourself become consumed by greeds or falsehoods. Write down who you wish to become. A disciplined person, a person free of restrictions placed onto you by you, a better person. Be aware of it. Prioritize it. Require it. <br>
<br>
Make a promise to yourself that you will become who you want to be. This is not as simple as it sounds. This promise to yourself needs to be significant. It will hold the weight of all of what you want to accomplish. This promise needs to satisfy all and in doing so it should become most of what you think about. What you do should be to fulfill this promise. <br> 
<br>
My promise to myself: <br>
<br>
1. I am a person who isn’t controlled by urges.<br>
2. I am a person of constant improvement.<br>
3. I am a disciplined person.<br>
4. I am a person who craves knowledge and success.<br>
5. I am a person content with the way I live my life.<br>

            If you let yourself become someone consumed by urges, you will become the urges. When picturing who you wish to become, is this person consumed by the addictions and issues you face now? Of course not.<br>
<br>
“Just one last time”<br>
<br>
An incredibly harmful set of words that which strung together can be detrimental for ones health both physically and mentally. Whatever these desires may be, you will never quit if the cycle continues. One last time, one last time, one last time. You feel guilty every time but this isn’t about the guilt. Think about how giving into these urges effects you and your brain.<br>
<br>
“New year new me”<br>
<br>
A different set of words, harmful alike. You may start to become better for a couple weeks or maybe even a month but the “New Year New Me” mindset never lasts. If you do make progress, what’s stopping you from replacing that expression with a new one: New Month New Me. What about New Week New Me? This new way of bettering yourself will lay a stronger foundation for who you can become and will give way to new possibilities. If you live every day with the idea that you can better yourself and others around you, why wouldn’t you.<br>

        <div class="chapter-text">
            Allowing yourself down time is required, but don’t let this become an excuse.<br>
<br>
As you progress and develop, a break will be essential, however, it is common for one to excuse laziness as required time off. Growing means constant persistence toward your goals, aspirations, and your promises to yourself. This means commitment and energy toward what means the most. 2 steps forward one step back means even though you may not always be moving forward, you are still becoming stronger, learning, and improving. Once you have built a strong base, you can begin to chisel your way to perfection. Refinement of yourself means accepting that your environment needs to be aligned with your values, biotic and abiotic.<br> 
<br>
Biotic<br>
The people you surround yourself with will define who you are. It is remarkably straightforward. You can become whoever you desire by fraternizing with that person. If you circulate your life with athletes, you will become one. Success alike. If you have been chained down at a specific level of skill for too long, let yourself befriend people of higher levels of skill. You will forget you were ever chained down.<br>
<br>
Abiotic<br>
The things you do control you just as much as the people. What is life if you engage is disheartening activities? The music you listen to will leave you feeling akin to the music. Why solely listen to such bleak music when it leaves you bleak? Naturally, everyone feels emotions at some point in their lives due to reasons out of their control. People tend to listen to upsetting music if they feel upset however why limit yourself? This forces you to stay in this upsetting phase for a time beyond reason. Let yourself be indifferent to the next song that plays. Enjoy it.<br>

        <div class="chapter-text">            
Achieving goals at the least means doing things you despise to perspire. Things you know you need to do, for instance, quitting addictions or fixing bad habits. Reaching goals demands not only to set yourself on the correct path, but taking time to understand what each path has to offer. This also means understanding any given path is or isn’t right for you. On your path, developing strong discipline is imperative as it will help guide you. It will help show you the correct path. You may not want to arise early in the morning to start working, but strong discipline will show you it is the right thing to do. It will make you feel guilty if you don’t. This takes hard work and you won’t get there without effort.<br> 
<br>
The type of person you want to become won’t get that way by wishing or hoping. To wish and to hope is to desire. Its to expect successful outcomes without meaningful input. This is not referring to every day life, this is solely referring to your own outcome. You can’t wish you will get up early tomorrow morning, you can’t hope people buy products you sell. Make yourself get up early tomorrow, make people buy what you sell. Give yourself, and them, a reason.<br>

“The person who loves walking will walk further than the person who loves the destination.”<br>
<br>
When you set stationary goals, you allow yourself to have a final destination and in a way, limit yourself. If you want to jump higher, why put a roof over your head? When pursuing your promises, make sure they have no end point. If you stay inside and stare at the roof over your head all day, you may never get to experience the beauty that lies amongst the clouds. In other words, discover new options, push onward, and prevail. Understand that there is always more to learn and do. <br>
<br>
This is not confined to success, either. Permit your path to branch off in the route to success. Get married, start a family if you choose. These are still successes but which may not hold true to ones original ideas of success. Your ideas of success can and will change. Don’t force them not to. Changing ideas of success is a good thing, it means you are finding yourself. If are starting your journey of success and see a path in front of you, it isn’t your path. Your path is one you created by you. It may start out on someone else’s path, but you can’t stay on it forever. Replicating a set of decisions won’t replicate the results.<br>

Being content with how you live your life doesn’t just mean a life free of guilt. All though it may seem that way, being content with how you live your life is not the same as being confident that the way you live your life is perfect. Living life with no guilt is different for everybody but it will continue to blossom. At my current state, I could live my life free of guilt for a week and have new things to feel wrongly about. Being content with how you live your life means renewing the ideas that will make you feel content. The path will change.<br>
<br>
Do you wish to spend the hours in your day not only doing the things you will regret, but then filling the following hours regretting that you did it, or do you wish to spend the hours in your day doing meaningful work and the rest of it being proud and content of the work you did. If you wish to be content with your life, the correct option is clear.<br>

            This is a spectacular world. Don’t put it to waste. Living is an incredibly complex thing that is mentally taxing. This requires being able to live with what goes on around you. Most things are outside of your control, you mustn’t be taken off track by them. One must not be completely psychologically changed by events not under their command. Use what you do control to your advantage. Take care of it. <br>
<br>
You must learn to live with the following<br>
1. Your people.<br>
2. Your environment.<br>
3. All there is to offer.<br>
4. Your time.<br>
5. Yourself.<br>

        <div class="chapter-title">Living 2-1, Kith</div>
        <div class="chapter-text">
            Living with the people around you means respecting who they are as a person and the decisions they make, respecting the negatives they come with. It means that even though you can disagree with the decisions they make, it is not always your place to try and change it. Living with the people around you also means appreciating who they are and the decisions they make, their positives. Your true kith will make decisions surrounding you to support you as best they can, just as you would do for them. Care means doing things you wouldn’t always do for the people you love, but it also means to do good for the people you interact with throughout your day, week, month, year, and life. Just because you will never see someone again, that doesn’t mean what you do won’t affect them.<br> 
<br>
The people you surround yourself with are there for a reason. They are in your life because you allow them to be, but also because they allow you to be. It’s sometimes hard to take a step back and think about these people in a real sense. These people are there for you when you need, whatever the situation may be. Each relationship gives way for new streams of help. This also means that you will act equally toward these people and relationships. There is no one sided relationship.<br>

            You were born into this life and environment for a reason. Every time you move around, change, or stay the same, it’s for a reason. Everything you do comes with meaning and you are always one decision away from changing that meaning. There is nothing stopping you from trying to move across the world and start a new life yet you don’t. Why is that, commitments? Commitments will mean nothing soon enough. This decision, to or not to move across the world and start a new life is, will change the course of your life. Of course it will, doing so would result in you being 6000km away from where you are now and not doing so will result in you remaining where you are. Both these options give way to completely new possibilities. Meeting new people, starting new families, creating new memories. Both can be done in both scenarios yet both will be vastly different.<br>
<br>
You were born into this life and environment for a reason, but not just born in the traditional sense. Moving across the world means being reborn in a way. It means not just starting a new chapter of your life, starting a new book of your new life there. You could write two boundlessly different books on whichever path you choose, wether it be remaining where you are, or starting fresh in a new life 6000km away.<br>

Life is full of wonders, big and small. It is easy to get overwhelmed by them but it is still important to pay attention to them. Everything is here for a reason, even it it fails to look that way. Everything is involved in multiple ecosystems larger than itself. The grass doesn’t just grow to grow. Plants need it but they don’t just need it to grow, they need it to spread. Spreading means more plants for other things that need the grass too. Taking looks into all the crevices our planet has to will let your mind grow in ways you couldn’t imagine. The features our home holds are vastly infinite. Everything has a purpose here, even you.<br>
<br>
As you learn about these new regions across earth, you will start to see yourself gain a deeper appreciation for these areas. If all you do is take what is given to you without questioning it, you will never appreciate the work that went into getting that thing to you. Learn about how things work, how those things affect you and how you affect them. This lets you become mentally calmed as you start to get rid of the things that are bad for you and appreciate the good. Everything has a purpose and sometime that purpose is not in your best interest, but in the interest of the man you once wished to be.<br>

        <div class="chapter-text">
            Time moves forward, stopping for no-one, and it always will. There is nothing you can do about it. This can be good or bad depending how you look at it.<br>
<br>
Time moving forward means that you have a limit. You will go eventually and that is what makes our life so special. Life would be meaningless if we lived forever so you have to make it count. Make an impact on the world. Do something with your time here. Imagine yourself on your deathbed thinking about how you lived your life. What do you wish to see, a life of regret or a life of satisfaction. A half lived life or a life lived fuller than you ever thought you could. <br>
<br>
Time moving forward means that you have to use it wisely. It is common for people to often fall short of their goals, but what if they dreamed bigger. If they dreamed bigger, falling short of that new goal would still make your finished product even better than your original goal. This has its limits and is only true to an extent, but you need to work to find that limit. Why lessen yourself? Why not try to at least find that limit and give it a little push? <br>

You. Your life is about you. You come first in your life. With this comes respecting your own decisions, even when you feel like you can’t. There will be times when you are forced to make decisions that you might not want to make and you have to understand and respect that decision. You know what is best for you. <br>

When a baby is born and starts to grow, it takes on a special outlook on life. The young child has a sense of creativity, an interest in everything surrounding them. The child develops a wondrous sense of being that allows it to solve problems in unique ways. This child lives in a boundless world. As the child takes on years, the people surrounding the child will start to put up walls, taking this child’s boundless world and binding it with rules. The child’s mind begins to be chained up and locked into a way of thinking. In the way we live life, this is the only way of thinking that is allowed. We have to follow rules, everyone does. Everybody has a boss, everyone has to obey the regulations except the ones that allow themselves to unchain their brain. Those that allow their brain to live as a hopeful child again, become this child again. <br>
            <br>
            Break free of the chains. Don’t let yourself be bound. Be yourself.<br>

You are responsible for the outcome of your life. You do not need money, luck, or smarts to be successful. True success is made. People with your idea of success arent born successful, they drive to achieve skills to create success. You can do the same, but you must understand a few things before starting.<br>
<br>
1. There is no good without bad.<br>
2. What is gratification.<br>
3. Influence.<br>
4. Mental effects.<br>
5. Physical effects.<br>
<br>
These 5 pillars will hold up your future success and without understanding all of them, your roof will crumble on top of you. Just like my previous writings, the best time to start is right now, but that does not mean you will become successful right now. Good things take time. This is something often struggled with on the pursuit of success. It is human nature to have a difficult time committing to one thing for a long time. <br>
<br>
To cope with this, understand that there is no good without bad. You can’t be feel happiness if you have never felt sadness. Use delayed gratification practices. Forcing yourself to get used to the uncomfortableness involved in time passing void of stimuli will help to relieve the future stress that will incur. Understand influence. Influence is around us everywhere in the things we do, places we go, and people we see. Become aware of the mental and physical effects that your actions have on you as well as how you can change them.<br>
