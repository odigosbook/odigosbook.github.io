            Promise yourself you will become the person you wish to be. Don’t let yourself become consumed by greeds or falsehoods. Write down who you wish to become. A disciplined person, a person free of restrictions placed onto you by you, a better person. Be aware of it. Prioritize it. Require it. <br>
<br>
Make a promise to yourself that you will become who you want to be. This is not as simple as it sounds. This promise to yourself needs to be significant. It will hold the weight of all of what you want to accomplish. This promise needs to satisfy all and in doing so it should become most of what you think about. What you do should be to fulfill this promise. <br> 
<br>
My promise to myself: <br>
<br>
1. I am a person who isn’t controlled by urges.<br>
2. I am a person of constant improvement.<br>
3. I am a disciplined person.<br>
4. I am a person who craves knowledge and success.<br>
5. I am a person content with the way I live my life.<br>

            If you let yourself become someone consumed by urges, you will become the urges. When picturing who you wish to become, is this person consumed by the addictions and issues you face now? Of course not.<br>
<br>
“Just one last time”<br>
<br>
An incredibly harmful set of words that which strung together can be detrimental for ones health both physically and mentally. Whatever these desires may be, you will never quit if the cycle continues. One last time, one last time, one last time. You feel guilty every time but this isn’t about the guilt. Think about how giving into these urges effects you and your brain.<br>
<br>
“New year new me”<br>
<br>
A different set of words, harmful alike. You may start to become better for a couple weeks or maybe even a month but the “New Year New Me” mindset never lasts. If you do make progress, what’s stopping you from replacing that expression with a new one: New Month New Me. What about New Week New Me? This new way of bettering yourself will lay a stronger foundation for who you can become and will give way to new possibilities. If you live every day with the idea that you can better yourself and others around you, why wouldn’t you.<br>

            Allowing yourself down time is required, but don’t let this become an excuse.<br>
<br>
As you progress and develop, a break will be essential, however, it is common for one to excuse laziness as required time off. Growing means constant persistence toward your goals, aspirations, and your promises to yourself. These means commitment and energy toward what means the most. 2 steps forward one step back means even though you may not always be moving forward, you are still becoming stronger, learning, and improving. Once you have built a strong base, you can begin to chisel your way to perfection. Refinement of yourself means accepting that your environment needs to be aligned with your values, biotic and abiotic.<br> 
<br>
Biotic<br>
The people you surround yourself with will define who you are. It is remarkably straightforward. You can become whoever you desire by fraternizing with that person. If you circulate your life with athletes, you will become one. Success alike. If you have been chained down at a specific level of skill for too long, let yourself befriend people of higher levels of skill. You will forget you were ever chained down.<br>
<br>
Abiotic<br>
The things you do control you just as much as the people. What is life if you engage is disheartening activities? The music you listen to will leave you feeling akin to the music. Why solely listen to such bleak music when it leaves you bleak? Naturally, everyone feels emotions at some point in their lives due to reasons out of their control. People tend to listen to upsetting music if they feel upset however why limit yourself? This forces you to stay in this upsetting phase for a time beyond reason. Let yourself be indifferent to the next song that plays. Enjoy it.<br>

Achieving goals at the least means doing things you despise to perspire. Things you know you need to do, for instance, quitting addictions or fixing bad habits. Reaching goals demands not only to set yourself on the correct path, but taking time to understand what each path has to offer. This also means understanding any given path is or isn’t right for you. On your path, developing strong discipline is imperative as it will help guide you. It will help show you the correct path. You may not want to arise early in the morning to start working, but strong discipline will show you it is the right thing to do. It will make you feel guilty if you don’t. This takes hard work and you won’t get there without effort.<br> 
<br>
The type of person you want to become won’t get that way by wishing or hoping. To wish and to hope is to desire. Its to expect successful outcomes without meaningful input. This is not referring to every day life, this is solely referring to your own outcome. You can’t wish you will get up early tomorrow morning, you can’t hope people buy products you sell. Make yourself get up early tomorrow, make people buy what you sell. Give yourself, and them, a reason.<br>

“The person who loves walking will walk further than the person who loves the destination.”<br>
<br>
When you set stationary goals, you allow yourself to have a final destination and in a way, limit yourself. If you want to jump higher, why put a roof over your head? When pursuing your promises, make sure they have no end point. If you stay inside and stare at the roof over your head all day, you may never get to experience the beauty that lies amongst the clouds. In other words, discover new options, push onward, and prevail. Understand that there is always more to learn and do. <br>
<br>
This is not confined to success, either. Permit your path to branch off in the route to success. Get married, start a family if you choose. These are still successes but which may not hold true to ones original ideas of success. Your ideas of success can and will change. Don’t force them not to. Changing ideas of success is a good thing, it means you are finding yourself. If are starting your journey of success and see a path in front of you, it isn’t your path. Your path is one you created by you. It may start out on someone else’s path, but you can’t stay on it forever. Replicating a set of decisions won’t replicate the results.<br>

Being content with how you live your life doesn’t just mean a life free of guilt. All though it may seem that way, being content with how you live your life is not the same as being confident that the way you live your life is perfect. Living life with no guilt is different for everybody but it will continue to blossom. At my current state, I could live my life free of guilt for a week and have new things to feel wrongly about. Being content with how you live your life means renewing the ideas that will make you feel content. The path will change.<br>
<br>
Do you wish to spend the hours in your day not only doing the things you will regret, but then filling the following hours regretting that you did it, or do you wish to spend the hours in your day doing meaningful work and the rest of it being proud and content of the work you did. If you wish to be content with your life, the correct option is clear.<br>
